# Penguin-Classification-

This is my first data science web app that predicts the species of penguins as a function of their input parameters (bill length, bill width, flipper length, body mass, sex and island).

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

Streamlit
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Pickle
